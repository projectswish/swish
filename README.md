# Swish
Encrypted messaging and OTC trading app, built for Near
# Features of Swish:
Communicate directly and anonymously by messaging/phone/video with any other wallet owner in the world, based only on knowing their wallet addresses.
Trade crypto assets and NFTs P2P via an integrated ESC (escrow smart contract) functionality.
Make communications, file storage, and transactions secure from hackers and government censorship via a decentralised distributed node network.
Receive rewards for app use and content creation (personalised channels and broadcasts), in addition to paying for additional services/subscriptions, via the SWS token.
Offer premium content (lessons, seminars, influencer videos, etc.) on public channels to other platform users, in exchange for payments via the SWS token.
# The Swish solution offers numerous benefits to users:

Messaging Security – Swish data storage, complete anonymity, no data transfers, no moderators, and complete end-to-end encryption. The node-to-node communication protocol means all messages between users are stored on trusted nodes, directly on our Near-based Blockchain network. Users can sign up exclusively with their wallet addresses, validated by the node network, while maintaining complete anonymity.

Trading Flexibility – Swish allows crypto owners to do something unprecedented, namely communicate and trade with each other without having to know each other, or having each other’s data on a contact list. This opens up endless opportunities for exchanging messages, files, and assets between previously disconnected individuals – an enormous step in encouraging the adoption of crypto currency and creating liquidity in the market.

Cost Effectiveness – Allowing users to trade crypto assets in a cost-effective way – be it fungible ones (ether, bitcoin etc.) or non-fungible ones (NFTs), directly P2P. This helps users avoid the fees, congestion, and liquidity issues affecting Centralised (CEX) and Decentralised (DEX) crypto exchanges.

Data Security – Files are stored on trusted, independent nodes in the Swish network, and transfers happen on a P2P basis, based on an encrypted procedure verified by the parties involved alone. No more data breaches, hacks, password leaks, or any other risk affecting existing cloud storage solutions.

Swish essentially creates a global Web 3.0 era platform for all crypto wallet owners to trade and communicate between each other – all from a single place, and with tangible advantages over existing trading and messaging solutions.

# The Swish Trading Solution – The Power Of Blockchain, Without The Disadvantages of Crypto Exchanges
The OTC Advantage - Trading of crypto assets to date has been relegated to DEXs and CEXs. Swish enables the growth of an OTC ecosystem, whereby the notion of an exchange disappears completely and is replaced by individual traders directly interacting with one another, wallet to wallet.  Swish OTC trading has significant advantages:

Market Impact – The fragmentation of liquidity across crypto exchanges poses significant challenges for investors who want to limit market impact when executing large orders. OTC is therefore an option to address this issue. Especially when executing block trades that are less sensitive to the Blockchain settlement price. Swish allows traders to contact each other one-to-one or one-to-many with message “blasts”, which are a quick way to find out interested buyers and liquidity pocket in the market. This enables a faster execution than that of existing exchanges, at a more favourable price.

Price Flexibility – As cryptos are a completely novel asset class, prices remain extremely volatile. OTC trading has the advantage of allowing for traders to negotiate prices, especially for NFTs, in a way beneficial to all parties involved.

Asset Range – OTC is the perfect way to trade NFTs, which do not have publicly quoted prices but depend on buyer/seller negotiations. Swish users can identify specific NFTs they want to invest in, and connect directly with the owner via the messaging function. This allows the investor to access previously unaccessible crypto assets, and the NFT owner to rapidly find an interested buyer.

# Development and Timelines
The development roadmap is as follows

Developing an Escrow Contract for enabling OTC Trading (Rust)
Developing the encrypted messaging protocol to enable messaging (Rust)
Messaging & File transfers
Identity Sharing & Asset Trading
Developing UI for sending and receiving messages (React JS)
SWS token incentivization for running messaging nodes on Swish
Cross Chain Messaging for wallets
The team is actively looking to hire developers to help pursue this objective
